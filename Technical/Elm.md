# Elm notes
### Overview

# Problems with JS

* JS is error prone
  - also ignores exceptions
    Type checking is not native: Need something like Flow
* JS is not immutable/stateless

---

# Elm features

* Static type system
  - no runtime errors
  - no `null`
  - all functions are immutable
  - beautiful and useful error message
