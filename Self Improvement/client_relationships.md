# Preparing for client meetings
** Developer tea podcast **

  * New clients meet you to succeed with you

    Want more confidence in your abilities. They want to trust you.

    You are not trying to proove that you are the best among all the developers. But rather that the clients made a good choice.

    Tring to outperform everyone is not everything.

    "Lean into the confidence the client wants to achieve"
    "Treat the client as if you are already a partner. be reassuring"


  * Clients appreciate new ideas and poissibilities

    Devs have a unique perspective. Dont be afraid to give creative suggestions especially in early stages.

    Does not work with everyone. Wont work if the client is not primarily responsible for decision making. Or if the project has already begun.


  * Never assume a budget

    Ignore a client budget. Do not shut down ideas but maybe not in the particular budget. 

    Belive in ideas first, before restricting budget.

    Any budget mention is always a guideline - empower the client to envision the ideal product and take them down the journey together.

    Be open to the client - talk about what is possible and guide them in decision making.


  * Provide a feature set that meets 
    - minimum budget
    - max budget
    - and ideal budget ( > max )
