#Feedback for Erika

I have had the opportunity to work with Erika on the spotlight project, and will base my answers on the experience of working together on the same.

1. What's been great about working with her so far?
  
  * Very friendly
    
    One of the best things about working with Erika is that she is always
    cheerful and excited about the project. This motivates the team to spend
    more time improving the design of the product as she is great to work
    with.

  * Design skills

    Erika brings a lot of skills to any project that are complimentary to those
    of the engineers. The design studio and learning plan creation session she
    organised were very valuable to help create a shared vision for the final
    product among the devs. These sessions also helped validate that we were
    building a product that fulfilled a real need.

  * Encourages learning

    She has been encouraging of my intrest in design and user research. She
    shared a few good resources for the same, which I have found very useful.
    Erika also let me conduct a few interviews and provided me with feedback on
    how to improve.

2. What areas have you seen her improve in so far?

  * Facilitation skills

    Over the course of the Spotlight project, Erika has shown a clear
    improvement in her facilitation skills. Initially, she had trouble managing
    the design studio session. Yet, by the end of the project she was able to
    conduct and lead the interviews and design sessions with ease.

3. What's the most important area you'd like her to focus on improving in? Why?

  * Frontend development skills: 

    As a designer, Erika will have to spend a significant portion of her time
    working on front end designs. Having an understanding of the various
    frontend technologies and their limitations will help her be more
    pragmatic in her aproach. 

    Another reason this is I believe this is the most important skill she
    needs to develop at present is because it will enable Erika to create her
    own style guides. I have seen firsthand the benefit of having a style
    guide on a large project and how it makes the whole application feel more
    cohisive.

    She will also be able to tweak and make small changes to the application
    design on her own, without having to wait on a dev to be available.

  * Articulating design choices: 

    One of my observations working with Erika was that she would not be very
    articulate about her reasoning behind design choices. For example, most of
    her explanations for decisions tend to be on the lines of 'this feels
    better', instead of talking in terms of 'directing user attention' or
    'balancing warm and cool colors'.

    The ability to effectively articulate design decisions is critical to the
    success of a project. I believe that a great designer has the ability to not
    only solve problems with design, but to also articulate how their solution
    solves it in a way thatâ€™s compelling and fosters agreement. 

    That being said, in no way do I think this is an easy task. I remember
    Justin's talk about how he tries to be articulate with his design choices. I
    wish Erika the best in leveling up.

4. Are there any notes or observations you'd like to share that aren't covered by the three questions above? Please share here!
